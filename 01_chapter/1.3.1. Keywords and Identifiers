* Identifiers

Python Identifiers
Identifier is the name given to entities like class, functions, variables etc. in Python. It helps differentiating one entity from another.

Rules for writing identifiers
Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is perfectly fine.
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

E.g:

>>> global = 1
  File "<interactive input>", line 1
    global = 1
           ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.

>>> a@ = 0
  File "<interactive input>", line 1
    a@ = 0
     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Identifier can be of any length.
